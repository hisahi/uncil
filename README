UNCIL IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. THE MAJOR VERSION 0 IS RESERVED FOR
PRE-RELEASE BUILDS. BREAKING ABI/API CHANGES MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME UNTIL
IT ROLLS OVER TO 1. PRE-RELEASE BUILDS MAY HAVE SEVERE BUGS AND SHOULD NOT
BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

Uncil is a scripting language inspired by languages like Lua, Python
and JavaScript. It is designed to be portable and support multithreading,
yet have high performance. It is also designed to be embeddable into C
programs as a scripting engine.

Uncil uses a dynamic type system (duck typing). Memory management is done
with a combination of reference counting and garbage collection (currently
stop-the-world but there are plans to make it incremental).

The current Uncil version is v0.8.0. Major version changes entail breaking
API or ABI changes and minor version changes entail ABI changes.
The Uncil language, standard library, C API and compilation instructions
are documented in the docs folder. Some example programs can be found under
the examples folder.
